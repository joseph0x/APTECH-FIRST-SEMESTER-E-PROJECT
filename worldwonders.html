        <b>Christ The Redeemer</b> is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio
        de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French sculptor Paul Landowski and built
        by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with
        French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida
        sculpted the face.
        <br />
        <br />
        Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high,
        excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92
        ft) wide. It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone. Christ the
        Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial
        plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the
        other. Although the project organisers originally accepted the design,
        it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
        The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is
        located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft) Corcovado mountain in
        the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. A
        symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a
        cultural icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the
        New Seven Wonders of the World.

      Vincentian priest Pedro Maria Boss first suggested placing a Christian
      monument on Mount Corcovado in the mid-1850s to honor Princess Isabel,
      regent of Brazil and the daughter of Emperor Pedro II, but the project was
      not approved.The Catholic Circle of Rio made a second proposal for a
      landmark statue on the mountain in <i><b>1920</b></i
      >. The group organized an event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument
      Week") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building
      of the statue. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The
      designs considered for the <i><b>"Statue of the Christ" </b></i> included

        Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and artist Carlos Oswald designed
        the statue. French sculptor Paul Landowski created the work. In 1922,
        Landowski commissioned fellow Parisian Romanian sculptor Gheorghe
        Leonida, who studied sculpture at the Fine Arts Conservatory in
        Bucharest and in Italy. A group of engineers and technicians studied
        Landowski's submissions and felt building the structure of reinforced
        concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable
        for the cross-shaped statue.
        <i class="fw-semibold"
          >The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden.</i
        >
        The outer layers are soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and
        ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931, and cost
        the equivalent of US$250,000 (equivalent to $3,800,000 in 2021) and the
        monument opened on October 12, 1931. During the opening ceremony, the
        statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by
        Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200
        kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but because of bad weather, the
        lights were activated on site.[8] In October 2006, on the 75th
        anniversary of the statue's completion, Cardinal Eusebio Oscar Scheid,
        Archbishop of Rio, consecrated a chapel, named after Brazil's patron
        saint—Our Lady of the Apparition—under the statue, allowing Catholics to
        hold baptisms and weddings there. <br />
        Lightning struck the statue during a violent thunderstorm on February
        10, 2008, causing some damage to the fingers, head and eyebrows. The Rio
        de Janeiro state government initiated a restoration effort to replace
        some of the outer soapstone layers and repair the lightning rods on the
        statue.
        <br />
        Lightning damaged it again on January 17, 2014, dislodging a finger on
        the right hand. In 2010, a massive restoration of the statue began. Work
        included cleaning, replacing the mortar and soapstone on the exterior,
        restoring iron in the internal structure, and waterproofing the
        monument.

        The <b>Great Wall Of China</b> is a series of fortifications that were
        built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states
        and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
        Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
        century BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang
        (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall
        remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
        multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall
        were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included
        border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported
        along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the
        control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive
        characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
        watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
        through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the
        Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. The frontier walls
        built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they
        stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the
        present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the
        south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian
        steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the
        defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the
        most impressive architectural feats in history.

      The earliest sections of the wall were constructed during the Warring
      States period (475-221 BCE) to defend against attacks by nomadic tribes
      from the north. These walls were primarily made of earth and timber and
      were not continuous structures. The construction of the Great Wall began
      in earnest during the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE), when the first emperor of
      China, Qin Shi Huang, ordered the walls to be connected and fortified. The
      walls were extended and rebuilt during the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE)
      to protect the Silk Road trade routes from the north.

        During the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420-589 CE), the
        walls fell into disrepair, and the nomadic tribes were able to penetrate
        further into Chinese territory. However, the Sui dynasty (581-618 CE)
        began rebuilding and extending the walls again in order to protect their
        empire from northern invaders. The walls were primarily made of tamped
        earth during this period, which proved to be a relatively inexpensive
        and effective building material.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) continued to maintain and rebuild the
        walls, particularly in the western regions where they were most
        vulnerable to attack. The Tang dynasty also expanded Chinese influence
        into Central Asia, which reduced the need for extensive wall building in
        those areas.
        <br />
        During the Song dynasty (960-1279 CE), the walls were again neglected as
        the dynasty focused on internal development rather than external
        defense. However, the Song dynasty faced increasing pressure from the
        northern Liao dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which eventually led to the
        fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127 CE.
        <br />
        The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan, breached the wall in the 13th century
        and went on to conquer China. The Mongol Empire was followed by the Yuan
        dynasty (1271-1368 CE), which was also of Mongol origin. During the Yuan
        dynasty, the wall was not a major focus of defense, and many sections
        fell into disrepair.
        <br />
        The Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE) took power after overthrowing the
        Mongols, and the Ming emperors launched a massive building campaign to
        repair and extend the Great Wall. The Ming dynasty built many of the
        most well-known sections of the wall, including the sections near
        Beijing and along the northern border of China. The walls were made of
        brick and stone, which provided greater strength and durability than
        earlier materials.
        <br />
        In addition to building the wall, the Ming dynasty also constructed
        watchtowers, barracks, and other fortifications to increase the wall's
        effectiveness. The wall was also equipped with signal beacons and other
        communication systems to allow for rapid communication along the length
        of the wall.
        <br />
        Despite the impressive construction of the Ming-era Great Wall, it was
        not always effective in protecting China from invaders. The Manchus, a
        nomadic people from the northeast, invaded China in the 17th century and
        established the Qing dynasty (1644-1912 CE). The Qing dynasty did not
        focus on maintaining the Great Wall, instead relying on diplomacy and
        military campaigns to protect China's borders.
        <br />
        During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Great Wall became a symbol of
        Chinese national identity and pride. However, many sections of the wall
        fell into disrepair

        <b>Chichén Itzá</b> (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and
        traditional Yucatec Maya) was a large pre-Columbian city built by the
        Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is
        located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.
        <br />
        <br />
        Chichén Itzá was inhabited by the Maya people from around 600 CE to the
        13th century CE and was an important political, economic, and cultural
        center of the Maya civilization. The site exhibits a multitude of
        architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and
        of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The
        presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been
        representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico,
        but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these
        non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion. The name
        "Chichén Itzá" translates to "at the mouth of the well of the Itza,"
        referring to the nearby cenote, or natural sinkhole, that provided the
        city with water.

      Chichén Itzá was built in three distinct phases, each reflecting different
      architectural styles and cultural influences. The first phase, known as
      the Old Chichén period (600-800 CE), was characterized by the construction
      of large platform mounds and the use of stone and stucco for architectural
      decoration. This period was also marked by the construction of the Temple
      of the Initial Series and the Temple of the Chac Mool, both of which are
      still visible today.
      <br />
      The second phase, known as the Transitional Chichén period (800-1000 CE),
      saw the introduction of the Puuc architectural style, which featured
      intricate geometric designs and the use of limestone. During this period,
      the city's population grew significantly, and many new structures were
      built, including the Ball Court and the Caracol observatory.

      <span class="collapse green2" id="collapseThirdHistory">
        The third phase, known as the Late Chichén period (1000-1250 CE), was
        marked by the arrival of the Toltec people from central Mexico, who
        brought with them a new architectural style characterized by large,
        columned temples and detailed carvings. During this period, Chichén Itzá
        became a major political and economic center, with a large market and a
        network of roads connecting it to other Maya cities.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the most iconic structures at Chichén Itzá is the Temple of
        Kukulcan, also known as El Castillo. This pyramid-shaped temple was
        built during the Late Chichén period and is a testament to the city's
        architectural and engineering prowess. The temple is 98 feet tall and
        features a series of terraces, each with 91 steps, leading up to a flat
        platform at the top. In total, the temple has 365 steps, one for each
        day of the year.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another notable structure at Chichén Itzá is the Ball Court, which is
        the largest and best-preserved ball court in Mesoamerica. The court is
        545 feet long and 225 feet wide and features stone rings on either side
        of the court through which players would try to pass a rubber ball
        without using their hands or feet. The ball game was an important
        religious and political ritual in ancient Mesoamerican societies and was
        often used to resolve conflicts between cities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Chichén Itzá also features a number of other impressive structures,
        including the Temple of the Warriors, the Tzompantli platform, and the
        Temple of the Jaguar. The site also contains a number of cenotes,
        including the Sacred Cenote, which was used for religious ceremonies and
        sacrifices. Chichén Itzá declined in importance and was abandoned by the
        Maya people in the 13th century CE, likely due to a combination of
        factors including overpopulation, drought, and political instability.
        The site was rediscovered by Spanish explorers in the 16th century CE
        and was extensively studied and restored in the 20th century. Today,
        Chichén Itzá is a popular tourist destination and a UNESCO World
        Heritage site.

        The <b>Colosseum</b> is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the
        city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest
        ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
        amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the
        emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72 and was completed in 80 AD under
        his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81). Further modifications were
        made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors who
        were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the
        amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists and
        archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
        <br />
        <br />
        The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock),
        and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000
        spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience
        of some 65,000; it was used for gladiatorial contests and public
        spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous
        battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea
        battles. It also features four levels of seating and an elaborate system
        of tunnels and trapdoors beneath the arena. The building ceased to be
        used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused
        for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious order,
        a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

      The Colosseum was also a symbol of the power and grandeur of the Roman
      Empire. It was built on the site of Nero's Golden House, a sprawling
      palace that had fallen into disuse after Nero's death. By demolishing the
      palace and building the Colosseum in its place, Vespasian and Titus sought
      to demonstrate their commitment to public entertainment and the welfare of
      the Roman people. The Colosseum was used for a variety of public
      spectacles and games, including gladiatorial contests, wild animal hunts,
      mock naval battles, and public executions. These events were popular with
      the Roman people and served as a way for the ruling class to demonstrate
      their power and wealth. The games were often violent and brutal, with
      gladiators and animals fighting to the death for the entertainment of the
      spectators.

        Over time, the Colosseum became a symbol of the excesses and decadence
        of the Roman Empire. As the empire declined and Christianity became the
        dominant religion, the use of the Colosseum for public spectacles and
        games declined as well. The building fell into disrepair and was used
        for other purposes, including as a quarry for building materials.
        <br />
        <br />
        Despite its decline, the Colosseum remained an important symbol of
        Rome's ancient heritage. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a fortress
        and a church, and in the Renaissance, it was rediscovered by artists and
        architects who drew inspiration from its grandeur and scale. The
        building was extensively restored in the 18th and 19th centuries, and
        today, it is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions. In addition
        to its historical and cultural significance, the Colosseum has also
        played an important role in shaping modern attitudes towards
        entertainment and public spectacle. It has inspired countless works of
        art and literature, and its legacy can be seen in everything from modern
        sports stadiums to the entertainment industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, the Colosseum stands as a testament to the power and ingenuity of
        the Roman Empire, and it continues to inspire and awe visitors from
        around the world.

        <b>Petra</b> originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is
        a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to
        the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains
        forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea
        to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as
        early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would
        become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.
        Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence
        dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become
        their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's
        proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major
        regional trading hub.
        <br />
        <br />
        The city's most famous structure is the Treasury, a massive rock-cut
        building that was originally built as a tomb for a Nabataean king. The
        Treasury is adorned with intricate carvings and decorations, including
        images of mythological creatures and scenes from Nabataean life. It is
        believed to have been built in the 1st century CE, and it remains one of
        Petra's most popular tourist attractions. Petra's Monastery is another
        impressive rock-cut building that was built in the 3rd century BCE. It
        is believed to have been a temple or a tomb, and it features a large
        central hall with columns and intricate carvings. The Monastery is
        located high on a mountain, and visitors must climb a steep staircase to
        reach it.

      The decline of Petra began in the 3rd century CE, as the Roman Empire
      expanded into the region and established new trade routes. The city was
      abandoned by the 7th century, and it remained largely unknown to the
      outside world until the 19th century. In 1812, a Swiss explorer named
      Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered the city, and it quickly became an

        the city's ancient architecture and learn about its rich history and

        The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right
        bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was
        commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r.
        1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it
        also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece
        of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
        house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
        crenellated wall. Construction of the mausoleum was essentially
        completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for
        another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
        completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be
        around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion
        (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000
        artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad
        Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have
        been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.
        <br />
        <br />
        The emperor spared no expense in building the mausoleum, using the
        finest materials and employing skilled craftsmen from across the Mughal
        Empire. The Taj Mahal is made of white marble, which was quarried from
        the nearby town of Makrana. The marble was then transported to Agra by a
        fleet of elephants. The Taj Mahal is set in a vast complex that includes
        a mosque and a guest house. The complex is surrounded by a large garden,
        which is divided into four sections by water channels. The mausoleum
        itself is a symmetrical structure with a central dome, which is flanked
        by four smaller domes. The facade of the building is adorned with
        intricate carvings and inlaid with precious stones.

        Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain
        ridge. Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most
        familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu
        District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80
        kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it,
        cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical
        mountain climate. The Inca civilization had no written language and no
        European visited the site until the 19th century, so far as is known, so
        there are no written records of the site while it was in use. The names
